## FindASpot app
The FindASpot app uses the Yelp Fusion API to populate a MapView with venue searches. 

**NB: To run this app you need the "YelpAPIKeys.swift" class with the required API Key below:**

```swift 
struct YelpAPIKeys {
    static let baseSearchURL = "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term="
    static let apiKey = "ENTER YOUR API KEY HERE"
}
```
